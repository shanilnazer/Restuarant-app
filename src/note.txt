api call in js
--------------

AJAX

-XMLhttp
-fetch
-async await

redirection In react
--------------------

react-router-dom

        -npm i react-router-dom


import { 
    BrowserRouter as Router,  - all routing need components
    Routes                    - to set path for each component
    ,Route                    - morethan one path
     } from 'react-router-dom';


useParams      - hook used to access params from component url


REDUX
------

coupling  - many connection between parent and child component

props drilling - any coupling if any intermediate component have any errors all other childs will not work

to avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all the components independent 

for this react introduced a new technology - state management technology - 

redux process
---------------

create a new js file to keep states ,all the components can access the js file

-the components can access the datas from the js file but they can't update datas in js file

- Action -> a file with all the logics to update the state
-Dispatch -> method used to dispatch the logic in action file when the component need state updation
-Reducer -> update the datas in js file according to the payload response get from action file
